# YALP

Yet Another Ledger-cli Parser

## Description

This is another parser for a plain-text-accounting (PTA) file, written using ledger-cli (https://ledger-cli.org/) synthax.

This Python code read your ledger-cli file and store the date into a dictionary. The main code is provided with a couple of functions for writing reports in a HTML file. The idea is to dynamically create HTML web pages (opimized for a smartphone screen) ready to be published using a web server, maybe in your home network.

## Getting Started

```
